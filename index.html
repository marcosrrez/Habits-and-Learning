        <h3>James Clear's Atomic Habits Insights</h3>
        
        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the core principle of the '1% Better Every Day' concept?"
            answer="Small, consistent improvements compound over time. Minor changes of 1% can lead to significant results when done consistently, as improvements stack up exponentially."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Explain the Identity-Based Habit Formation approach"
            answer="Focus on who you wish to become, not just what you want to achieve. Change your beliefs about yourself first, and your actions will naturally align with your new identity."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the Two-Minute Rule in habit formation?"
            answer="Start habits by making them so easy you can do them in two minutes. The goal is to make the initial action so small that it becomes frictionless to begin, which helps overcome initial resistance."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Describe the concept of Environment Design in habit building"
            answer="Shape your surroundings to make good habits easier and bad habits harder. Your environment has a profound impact on your behavior, so intentionally design spaces that nudge you towards desired habits."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is Habit Stacking?"
            answer="Link new habits to existing routines to increase consistency. By anchoring a new habit to an established habit, you create a reliable trigger that makes the new behavior more likely to stick."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <h3>Cal Newport's Deep Work Insights</h3>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Define Deep Work according to Cal Newport"
            answer="Deep Work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a state of peak concentration where you produce high-quality work in less time."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Explain the concept of Digital Minimalism"
            answer="Intentionally reduce digital noise and focus on meaningful technological engagement. Carefully select and use digital tools that provide genuine value, eliminating unnecessary digital distractions."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the Passion Paradox?"
            answer="Don't blindly follow passion; instead, build skill and let passion follow expertise. True passion develops from becoming exceptionally good at something through deliberate practice."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Describe Time Block Planning"
            answer="Schedule every minute of your workday to maximize productivity. By intentionally allocating specific time blocks for different tasks, you create structure and minimize decision fatigue."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is Intentional Career Development?"
            answer="Systematically build rare and valuable skills. Focus on developing deep, unique capabilities that set you apart, rather than following a generic career path."
